# What is Oskar really listening to?
You can check his twitter bot [@oskar_jam_bot](http://twitter.com/oskar_jam_bot) to find out.

Using the Last.fm API (to which I have my Spotify plays scrobbling) and the twitter API I've knocked up a lil system where now anyone can check what I'm listening to as when this program is running it'll live tweet the music I listen to.
